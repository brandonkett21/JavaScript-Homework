I have created 3 seperate repos which include index.html, style.css, script.js. 

The index file contains a navbar, a container including the password generator, a slider, 2 buttons, and a text box. 

The style.css file includes styling for the container 

The script.js makes the password generator usable and able to generate a random password.
